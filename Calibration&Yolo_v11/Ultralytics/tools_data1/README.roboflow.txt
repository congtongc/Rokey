The dataset includes 2767 images.
Search-for-tools are annotated in YOLOv11 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Resize to 640x480 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* 50% probability of vertical flip
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -25 and +25 percent
* Random exposure adjustment of between -15 and +15 percent
